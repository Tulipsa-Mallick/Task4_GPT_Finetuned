# Task4_GPT_Finetuned
# 🧠 Task 1: Text Generation using GPT-2

## 📌 Overview

This task focuses on leveraging **GPT-2**, a powerful transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, for generating human-like text. The objective was to fine-tune GPT-2 on a custom dataset and generate coherent and contextually relevant content based on specific prompts.


## 🚀 Project Goals

* Understand the architecture of GPT-2
* Preprocess and tokenize custom text data
* Fine-tune GPT-2 on the dataset using `transformers` library
* Generate meaningful text outputs based on user-defined prompts
* Analyze the coherence, creativity, and quality of generated text



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Hugging Face Transformers**
* **PyTorch**
* **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**


## 📑 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Task-1-Text-Generation.git
 Task-1-Text-Generation


### 2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Fine-tune GPT-2

python train.py


> *Make sure your `data/custom_dataset.txt` contains cleaned, relevant training data.*

### 4. Generate Text

python generate_text.py

> You can modify the prompt inside `generate_text.py` or pass it interactively.


## 🧪 Sample Output

Prompt:


"The future of artificial intelligence is"


Generated Output:


"The future of artificial intelligence is both exciting and uncertain. As machines become more intelligent, ethical frameworks, transparency, and human collaboration will play a pivotal role in guiding AI towards societal benefit..."


## 🔍 Key Learnings

* Fine-tuning transformer-based language models on custom data
* Efficient use of Hugging Face Transformers API
* Prompt engineering for desired output
* Analyzing and interpreting AI-generated text
